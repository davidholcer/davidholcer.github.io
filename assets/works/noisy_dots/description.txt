A generative, interactive work in which colorful dots appear in square grids evenly spaced out within a larger square grid. A changing noise value determines the number of dots in each row and column, and their color. Interactive settings include noise speed ('-','='), max number of points per row/column of one square (numbered keys), total number of grids (scrolling/up & down arrow keys), and light/dark modes ('b') automatically determined based on current time i.e. day or night. Full controls may be found in the web console.
