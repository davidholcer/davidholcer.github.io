"Moving Points" is a generative interactive work in which randomly positioned points are in constant motion. Each point moves in a direction directly opposite the nearest point. The result is a state of dynamic equilibrium, which may be disturbed by adding, removing, or moving points; I invite you to do so. This work also includes interactive settings including color, opacity, speed, line width, line type, and light/dark modes. The dark/light mode is automatically determined based on your current time (night or day), but may also be toggled. Variable line width is determined by the distance between points (closer=thinner, further=thicker). Full controls may be found in the web console, otherwise click & scroll around with your keys and mouse.

Controls:
'a' to toggle automatically adding 1 point/second (indicated by a circle in the bottom right corner corner, initially ON)
'r' to toggle resetting points after 1 min (indicated by a double circle in the bottom right corner corner, initially ON)
'x' to randomize colors
'c' to randomize color scheme
'v' to invert line color
'b' to invert background and points
'i' to invert background and lines
'n' or SPACE to randomize points
'm' to toggle points
'k' to toggle variable width lines
'l' to toggle lines
';' to switch line type
'o' to toggle opacity
'p' to pause
'-' to decrease speed
'=' to increase speed
',' to lower opacity
'.' to increase opacity
Mouse scroll to increase line width
